# Pack Changes
I'm doing something a bit different here -- instead of listing every single change to the pack, I'm only listing those that might be confusing.

## Advanced Rocketry
- Added more ores to those that can spawn on asteroids

## Climate Control
- Turned off Mushroom Island Biomes

## Fossils and Archeology
- Removed Academy, Aztec Workshop, Fossil Sites, and Temple structures
